# cocos2dx-zone

This was my foray into teaching myself cocos2dx by porting the mostly-finished unreleased Breakout clone I had been working on at a previous employer. The architecture of the game was eerily similar to the way cocos2dx does things, particularly the Action functionality and the Animation controls. The core engine is intact, but I never explored a way to migrate the level creation tools, so theres only one static level. The original game had several block types, and some fancy particle effects, which I was looking into porting to the cocos2dx particle engine, but never quite finished.
